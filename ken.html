      <p>Ken Griffey Jr., in all of his badassery, has officially made his way into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.  He got so many votes, people lost their minds.  Seattle went crazy.  There is pandemonium in the streets due to baseball fans celebrating like you wouldn't believe.  Trust us.  It's insane.  Ken Griffey, Jr. was selected first overall in the June 1987 draft by the Mariners and less than two years later, at age 19, he was in center field on Opening Night in 1989. He proceeded to electrify the game of baseball in the 1990's, not just across the Northwest, but across the country. As testament to Griffey's talent and achievements, in 1999, he was one of 29 players named to the All-Century Team, a roster of the greatest players at each position in the history of MLB. On July 24, 2016, he will be officially inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
